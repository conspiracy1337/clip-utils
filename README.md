If Windows Defender shows a Warning you can safely ignore it as its just a reminder that the App is not signed (which costs upwards of $200 per year). If you are still suspicious just compile the py source code file yourself.

It says suspicious on 3/69 anti viruses (only trash ones lol), but if you click the "Behaviour" tab you can see everything it does for yourself.
